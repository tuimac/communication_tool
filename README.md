# Communication Tool Server
This is the simple communication tools server which have Jitsi and Mattermost.
Mattermost is the text base chat tool. Mattermost have only chat function and you can append the plugins to enhance itself.
Jitsi is the web conference tool. This time, I install Jitsi as the plugin of Mattermost. For the restriction, Jitsi docker container use the root context path and Mattermost use /mattermost path. These paths are generated by Nginx docker container.

## Architechture
This is the entire architechture of this cloudformation stack. Jitsi didn't apply for the sub context path of the reverse proxy server so use the root path.
